## Attendance

This class abides by the official attendance policy from the Tech901 Student Handbook:

> Students are expected to attend each class meeting and attendance will be kept
> by the instructor. Understanding that students will occasionally have reasons
> to miss class, each student is allowed to miss no more than five (5) class
> periods for the IT Professional/Hardware Technician tracks and no more than
> three (3) for the Software and Web Development track throughout the duration
> of the class. Students who miss more than the allowed class periods will be
> administratively withdrawn from the class on the event of the 6th or 4th
> (according to the track) absence and are not be eligible to pass the course.
> Students who withdraw or are administratively withdrawn due to attendance from
> two Tech901 classes will no longer be allowed to register for future Tech901 courses.
>
> Students are expected to be on time to class each day and classes will start
> at the scheduled time regardless of how many students are in attendance. Students
> who miss more than half of a class meeting will be counted as absent for that day.
>
> Attendance in class goes beyond classroom learning and provides instructors
> with the ability to speak to a studentâ€™s timeliness when talking with potential
> employers. When possible, it is important for students to communicate with
> instructors prior to an absence or tardy.
