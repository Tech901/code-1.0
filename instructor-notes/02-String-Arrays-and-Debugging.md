# Strings, Arrays, and Debugging

Typically week 2 in CS50.  Topics include:


## Day 1

- what are `char`s,
- what are strings (i.e. you can treat them like an array), `strlen`
- What is an array?
- What is the modulo operator and how can it work w/ arrays: `%`


Resources:

- point at the shorts... particularly `functions` and `scope`


## Day 2

- Work thru the lab.
- Illustrate `debug50`
