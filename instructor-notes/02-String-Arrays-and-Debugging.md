# Strings, Arrays, and Debugging

Typically week 2 in CS50.  Topics include:


## Day 1

Topics to address:

- what are `char`s,
- what are strings (i.e. you can treat them like an array), `strlen`
- What is an array?
- What is the modulo operator and how can it work w/ arrays: `%`


Resources / Example code.:

- point at the shorts... particularly `functions` and `scope`
- `examples/arrays/array_example.c` as an initial illustration of arrays.
- `examples/arrays/strings.c` as an example of strings as an "array of chars"
- `examples/arrays/modulo.c` to illustrate how the mod operator works.


## Day 2

- Work thru the lab.
- Illustrate `debug50`
- revisit `examples/arrays/array_example.c` but use dynamic sizing (based on user input?)
