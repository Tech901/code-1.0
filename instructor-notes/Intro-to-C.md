# Intro to C

Typically the first week of CS50 content.


## Day 1

Most of this will be a guided introduction to C programming:

- Create a Hello World program (`hello.c`) and talk about the process of compiling.
- Explain usage of clang or gcc vs. the CS50 `make` command.
- C basics:
    - data types
    - Mention that strings are a lie....
    - declaring / initializing variables
    - the `main` function (explain `return 0`, `void` input to main)
    - Talk about `printf` and format specifiers for different data types.
    - Talk about includes  (`stdio.h`, `cs50.h`)
    - Example code from `intro_to_c/`: `hello.c`, `count.c`, `floats.c`
    - `if`/`else`, `for`, `while`
    - end with an `argc` / `argv` example.


## Day 2

- work through the Lab 1 (hello and population)
- Talk about `examples/intro_to_c/grid.c`
- Start talking about functions
- Touch on boolean expressions, especially using `||` and `&&`.
    - example using primary colors?  (see: https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/color-basics.html)
